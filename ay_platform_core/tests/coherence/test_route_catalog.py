# Description: Pins the auth x role x scope test catalog
#              (`tests/e2e/auth_matrix/_catalog.py`) to the live FastAPI
#              routers exposed by every component. Fails the build if a
#              new route is introduced without a corresponding
#              EndpointSpec — the rule from CLAUDE.md §13.
