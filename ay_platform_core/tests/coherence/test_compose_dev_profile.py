# Path: ay_platform_core/tests/coherence/test_compose_dev_profile.py
# Description: Coherence checks on the dev compose stack
#              (`docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.dev.override.yml`).
#              Pins two invariants exposed by the 2026-05-13 incident :
#
#                1. mock_llm is gated by the `test` profile and SHALL NOT
#                   appear in the dev compose runtime. If it ever
#                   resurfaces in dev, the C4 orchestrator silently
#                   routes its C8 calls to canned BLOCKED responses
#                   (the bug we just chased).
#
#                2. Every API service that calls C8 (c2, c3, c4) SHALL
#                   pull `.env.dev` via the dev override so its
#                   `C8_GATEWAY_URL` points at real Ollama. A service
#                   that only reads `.env.test` falls back to
#                   `mock_llm:8000` — which is now profile-gated and
#                   absent from the dev stack — and crashes mid-call.
#
#              These tests run on file content only (no docker), so they
#              are deterministic and fast (<50 ms).
