# Description: Pydantic v2 data contracts for C3 Conversation Service.
#              ConversationPublic and MessagePublic are registered as
#              platform contracts (consumed by C1, C4, future UI).
#
#              v4: UNIFIED inline-event pipeline. `StageRecord` and
#              the short-lived `ToolCallRecord` are collapsed into a
#              single `InlineEvent` (discriminated by `kind`) and a
#              single `MessagePublic.events` list. One channel for
#              every kind of in-turn activity (pipeline stages,
#              DocGen tool calls, future kinds) : the service emits
#              them through one collector, the UX renders them through
#              one formatter registry, and the persisted list is one
#              queryable audit ledger. Legacy messages persisted with
#              the v3 `stages` field are projected into `events`
#              (kind="stage") at read time — no data migration. Only
#              terminal (`done`) events are persisted.
#
#              v3: `StageRecord` + `MessagePublic.stages` persist the
#              pipeline timeline (retrieve / generate / done phases
#              with durations + stats) alongside the assistant message.
#              The UX re-renders the same chip + collapsible panel on
#              navigation / reload, where previously the timeline was
#              transient (client-only `liveStages` state).
#
#              v2: `MessageRequest` carries optional `user_prompt` and
#              `project_prompt` fields. The UX fetches these from C2
#              at session start (user prefs) / project navigation
#              (project settings) and forwards them per-message so C3
#              can prepend both ahead of the RAG context block.
